  ## User Story
  
  ```md
    AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
    I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
    SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
    ```

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  ```md
    GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
    WHEN I load the portfolio
    THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
    WHEN I view the header
    THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
    WHEN I view the navigation titles
    THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
    WHEN I click on a navigation title
    THEN the browser URL changes and I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation and that title is highlighted
    WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
    THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
    WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
    THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
